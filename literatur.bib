Using particles connected by constraints as our fundamental building block allows us to treat contact and collisions in a unified manner, and we show how this representation is flexible enough to model gases, liquids, deformable solids, rigid bodies and cloth with two-way interactions. We address some common problems with traditional particle-based methods and describe a parallel constraint solver based on position-based dynamics that is efficient enough for real-time applications.},

  abstract = {The most popular approaches for the simulation of dynamic systems in computer graphics are force based. Internal and external forces are accumulated from which accelerations are computed based on Newton’s second law of motion. A time integration method is then used to update the velocities and finally the positions of the object. A few simulation methods (most rigid body simulators) use impulse based dynamics and directly manipulate velocities. In this paper we present an approach which omits the velocity layer as well and immediately works on the positions. The main advantage of a position based approach is its controllability. Overshooting problems of explicit integration schemes in force based systems can be avoided. In addition, collision constraints can be handled easily and penetrations can be resolved completely by projecting points to valid locations. We have used the approach to build a real time cloth simulator which is part of a physics software library for games. This application demonstrates the strengths and benefits of the method.},

  abstract  = {With the development of computer graphic and haptic devices, training surgeons with virtual reality technology has proven to be very effective in surgery simulation. Many successful simulators have been deployed for training medical students. However, due to the various unsolved technical issues, the laparoscopic surgery simulation has not been widely used. Such issues include modeling of complex anatomy structure, large soft tissue deformation, frequent surgical tools interactions, and the rendering of complex material under the illumination of headlight. A successful laparoscopic surgery simulator should integrate all these required components in a balanced and efficient manner to achieve both visual/haptic quality and a satisfactory refreshing rate. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework integrating a set of specially tailored and designed techniques, ranging from deformation simulation, collision detection, soft tissue dissection and rendering. We optimize all the components based on the actual requirement of laparoscopic surgery in order to achieve an improved overall performance of fidelity and responding speed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Integrating simulators with robotic surgical procedures could assist in designing and testing of novel robotic control algorithms and further enhance patient-specific pre-operative planning and training for robotic surgeries. Methods A virtual reality simulator, developed to perform the transsphenoidal resection of pituitary gland tumours, tested the usability of robotic interfaces and control algorithms. It used position-based dynamics to allow soft-tissue deformation and resection with haptic feedback; dynamic motion scaling control was also incorporated into the simulator. Results Neurosurgeons and residents performed the surgery under constant and dynamic motion scaling conditions (CMS vs DMS). DMS increased dexterity and reduced the risk of damage to healthy brain tissue. Post-experimental questionnaires indicated that the system was well-evaluated by experts. Conclusion The simulator was intuitively and realistically operated. It increased the safety and accuracy of the procedure without affecting intervention time. Future research can investigate incorporating this simulation into a real micro-surgical robotic system.},

Our model captures all the relevant aspects of the physics of the thread, including quasi-zero elasticity, bending, torsion and self-collision, and it provides output forces for the haptic feedback. The physical properties are modeled in terms of constraints that are iteratively satisfied while the numerical integration is carried out through a Verlet scheme. This approach leads to an unconditionally stable, controllable and computationally light simulation [M\"{u}ller et al. 2007]. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing the interaction of the thread with other objects in real time and the creation of complex knots.},

  abstract   = {We present a new approach for simulating deformable objects. The underlying model is geometrically motivated. It handles pointbased objects and does not need connectivity information. The approach does not require any pre-processing, is simple to compute, and provides unconditionally stable dynamic simulations.The main idea of our deformable model is to replace energies by geometric constraints and forces by distances of current positions to goal positions. These goal positions are determined via a generalized shape matching of an undeformed rest state with the current deformed state of the point cloud. Since points are always drawn towards well-defined locations, the overshooting problem of explicit integration schemes is eliminated. The versatility of the approach in terms of object representations that can be handled, the efficiency in terms of memory and computational complexity, and the unconditional stability of the dynamic simulation make the approach particularly interesting for games.},
